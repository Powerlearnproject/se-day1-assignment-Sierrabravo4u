Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering involves the design,development,testing and maintaining software systems.
it enhances business operations and improves life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Early Computing (1940s–1950s) – Birth of Software Development
The first digital computers, like the ENIAC (1946), required programmers to write machine code directly.
2. High-Level Programming Languages (1950s–1960s)
Introduction of FORTRAN (1957) and COBOL (1959) made programming more accessible.
3. Structured Programming (1960s–1970s)
The 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering formally introduced the term "software engineering."

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning: Defines the project scope, objectives, and feasibility.
2. Requirements Analysis: Gathers and documents user and system requirements.
3. Design: Architects the system structure and user interface.
4. Implementation (Coding): Developers write and integrate code using programming languages.
5. Testing: Ensures the software is bug-free and meets requirements.
6. Deployment: The software is released for use in production.
7. Maintenance & Support: Handles bug fixes, updates, and performance improvement

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology: Linear and sequential...Rigid; changes are difficult...Follows predefined stages... Minimal after requirements gathering... Performed at the end
it can be used in Banking or Government Projects: Strict regulations require detailed documentation and predefined workflows.
Agile Methodology: Iterative and incremental...  	Highly adaptable to changes.... Repeats cycles of planning, development, and testing in sprints.... Continuous feedback and collaboration.... Continuous testing throughout

it can be used in Mobile App Development: Features and user requirements change frequently.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer Role: Responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining software applications, Writing clean, efficient, and scalable code, Debugging and fixing software bugs, Integrating third-party services and API

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer Role: Ensures the software meets quality standards through testing, Designing test plans, test cases, and test scripts, Ensuring compliance with functional and security requirements, Conducting performance and stress testing.

Project Manager (PM) Role: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of the software project, Defining project scope, timeline, and objectives, Communicating with stakeholders and clients, Managing risks and resolving roadblocks.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An IDE is a software suite that provides developers with tools for writing, testing, and debugging code efficiently in a single interface. it Provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and formatting ,Allows developers to compile and run code within the environment and it also Allows developers to compile and run code within the environment.
example of an IDE is VS code

A VCS helps track changes to code over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate efficiently and revert to previous versions when needed it Enables teams to work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes and it also Protects code from accidental loss or corruption.
an example is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Debugging & Fixing Bugs for example Bugs and errors can be difficult to identify and resolve, leading to project delays and also Some bugs only appear under specific conditions e.g., race conditions
To overcome these challenges one need to Use debugging tools like Visual Studio Debugger, Chrome DevTools and also Follow a systematic debugging approach 

2.Balancing Code Quality vs. Speed :the  Pressure to deliver fast can lead to technical debt and poor code quality because Writing clean, maintainable code takes time.
One needs to Follow coding standards and best practices
 Conduct code reviews to maintain quality.
Write automated tests to ensure stability.
 Use refactoring techniques to improve code over time.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing this tests individual components  in isolation. and this is done Typically by developers using automated testing frameworks e.g PyTest for Python 
Integration Testing : this Tests how different modules or components interact and it Focuses on data flow between systems like APIs and databases
System Testing : this is done to Tests the complete application as a whole system to validate its functionality, performance, and security.it  Ensures the entire application functions correctly end-to-end.
 Acceptance Testing: this is used to Determines whether the software meets business and user requirements. it is Performed by QA teams, stakeholders, or end-users before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of  refining inputs to optimize responses from AI models, It involves structuring questions, instructions, or data in a way that ensures accurate, relevant, and useful outputs.
it is important because Well structured prompts guide AI to generate precise responses.
Enhances Efficiency & Productivity, Crafting detailed prompts helps reduce errors generated 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Write a blog on cybersecurity."
Improved Prompt: "Write a 500-word blog on cybersecurity, covering common threats, prevention strategies, and real-world examples."
